## Introduction
Within this directory you can find example code for figures and stats that might come in handy for simple coastal ecology projects.

There is an "example" folder with different figure examples that have been created using dummy data.

The "tidepools" and "seagrass" folders include worked examples based on the data collected by UCEAP groups in September 2023.

## Plotting advice
##### Types of figures
- **Barplots:** useful for displaying things like count data when you have categorical predictors on your x-axis.
- **Scatterplots:** good for viewing data with 2 continuous variables e.g., temperature on the y-axis and salinity on the x-axis. A linear regression line can also be added to highlight the overall trend of your data.
- **Boxplots:** useful for displaying data where you have a categorical variable on the x-axis and you have enough replicates to display meaningful summary statistics (mean, median, max, min).
##### Figure aesthetics
- Try and use colour-blind friendly colour palettes where possible.
- Axis and legend titles should make sense and be meaningful.
- Figure text should be clearly legible
- Avoid including a figure title (use a figure caption instead)
- Avoid dark or distracting figure themes (minimal and classic are the most popular)
##### Figure captions
- Make sure figure captions are placed below your figure.
- Figure captions should be as detailed as possible to allow the reader to understand your figure and data trends without looking at the rest of your text.
- Depending on your target journal, include summary statstics, p-values and other relevant statistics in your caption.
- Reiterate what different colours, symbols, categories etc. mean in your figures.
